# An early warning indicator trained on stochastic disease-spreading models with different noises
This repository contains codes and data of the paper entitled "An early warning indicator trained on stochastic disease-spreading models with different noises."

The training codes were generated from the Noise-Induced disease-spreading SIR model. The deep learning model training, applying, and testing codes are edited from published codes by Bury et al. (2021), Deep learning for early warning signals of tipping points, PNAS. 

Training data of the DL model is available at:
